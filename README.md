A simple, opinionated project seed for [React](https://reactjs.org/) featuring:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Typescript](www.typescriptlang.org) side-by-side.
* Awesome component scoped CSS with [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx).
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) enforcing standard style (haha, I said it's opinionated...).
* Quick, friction-free deployments with [surge](https://surge.sh/).
* Some useful [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings and extension recommendations.

### Why not just [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)?

Of course, always try the established standards first! I just wanted to take a quick look behind the things involved when setting up a simple React project in conjunction with a comfortable development experience. This is for sure not recommended for your bigger, mission critical stuff and by far not very complete.
